# Voice Control
## Demo for Web Speech API

Reads items in stocks, interacts after voice commands.

Optimized for latest version of Google Chrome.

Live demo here: <https://trohat.github.io/VoiceControl/>

#### Instructions:

Application starts reading and listening to commands after pressing the **start** button.

Supported voice commands are (*they are in Czech language*):

**"znovu"** or **"opakuj"** for repeating the same item.
**"dál"**, **"dále"**, **"další"** for going to next item.
**"stop"** or **"skonči"** for finishing.
Same results can be achieved by pressing the corresponding buttons.

*In some instances of Google Chrome, there is not available Czech language for reading. If this is the case, voice commands are still in Czech, but the text will be read in German.
(Try Microsoft Edge if you want to hear Czech reading voice, but voice commands will not work correctly there - use just buttons.)*
